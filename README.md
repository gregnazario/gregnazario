### Hi! 🧑🏻‍💻

- I used to work on the [Diem blockchain](https://github.com/diem/diem), but helped found and build the [Aptos blockchain](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core), where I'm [(currently) the top contributor](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/graphs/contributors).
- ⚡ I built my personal website on [IPFS](https://ipfs.gnazar.io) as well as a traditional [HTTPS](https://gnazar.io) website.
- 🌱 I’m thinking about ways to teach people who ask me questions about coding through tutorials.
